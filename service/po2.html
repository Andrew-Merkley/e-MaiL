Supplier may charge and Purchaser will pay applicable national, state or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (“VAT”), or goods and services taxes or similar transaction taxes (“GST”) that Supplier is legally obligated to pay to governmental authorities (collectively, “Taxes”).  Supplier’s original invoice to Purchaser must state those Taxes separately and meet the requirements for a compliant tax invoice. Supplier will submit to Purchaser a valid invoice for VAT, GST and similar Taxes, and comply with all applicable tax filing requirements with respect to payments under this Purchase Order.  Purchaser may withhold payment until Supplier provides invoices that comply with this Section 7. Purchaser may provide Supplier with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case, Supplier will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by that certificate. Purchaser may deduct or withhold any Taxes that Purchaser may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any amounts payable to Supplier under this Purchase Order, and payment to Supplier as reduced by those deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to Supplier of amounts payable under this Purchase Order.

To the extent that title to any digital or tangible property is transferred under this Purchase Order, title will transfer from Supplier to Purchaser upon acceptance by Purchaser.

Upon request of Purchaser, Supplier will promptly deliver to Purchaser all Work Product and other similar items, and all data, reports, summaries, estimates, and any other information or materials as Supplier may have collected or created in performing Services. Supplier will not be entitled to payment on any outstanding invoice until delivery of the foregoing items to Purchaser. </td> </tr>

Purchaser may terminate or modify this Purchase Order for any Goods after shipment and prior to Purchaser’s acceptance of such Goods, and Purchaser will pay only the shipping expenses for returning such Goods to Supplier’s shipping location and incur no further charge or liability. Upon cancellation of a Purchase Order related to Services after Supplier has commenced performance of such Services, Supplier will promptly terminate the Services and Purchaser is only liable to pay for Services performed and liabilities incurred prior to cancellation (except that if the specified fees are a fixed amount, Purchaser will pay a pro rata fee to the extent the Services are complete). Upon cancellation, Supplier will promptly deliver to Purchaser, without request, all deliverables, Work Product and other items, and all data, reports, summaries, estimates, and any other information or materials as Supplier may have collected or created in performing Services.

<td style="font-size: 8pt; text-align: left; vertical-align: top;"> <b>10. Rejection and other Remedies.</b>  If the Project does not strictly comply with the requirements of this Purchase Order, Purchaser may reject any or all of them within a reasonable period of time after delivery without regard to whether payment has been made. In such case, Purchaser may, at Supplier’s expense, (a) retain any or all of such Goods for correction by Purchaser or others, (b) return any or all of such Goods with or without instruction for correction or replacement or (c) procure replacement Goods from a third party and require Supplier to reimburse Purchaser for its associated costs and expenses associated. Supplier will promptly comply with any instruction for correction or replacement. If Purchaser requests Supplier to make any correction and Supplier thereafter fails or indicates its inability or unwillingness to do so, Purchaser may have the correction made by a third party and charge Supplier for all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with such correction. Supplier may, in lieu of rejection, retain any or all of such Goods for use as delivered, subject to an equitable adjustment in price as described below. Purchaser will be entitled to recover from Supplier (by credit, offset, refund, invoice or otherwise) an equitable amount for the diminished value of any uncorrected Goods and all costs reasonably incurred by Purchaser in connection with rejected Goods (including but not limited to all costs of correction by Purchaser or others and all costs to return Goods to Supplier).

Audit.</b>  Purchaser may upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours examine and make copies of all books and records relating to the Project or, if applicable, make a physical inspection of Supplier’s premises relating to Supplier’s performance of its obligations under the Purchase Order.

The Work Product has been specially ordered and commissioned by Purchaser as "work made for hire” for copyright purposes. To the extent such deliverable does not so qualify as “work made for hire”, and to the extent such deliverable includes material subject to copyright, patent, trade secret, or any other proprietary right, Supplier hereby assigns to Purchaser, its successors and assigns, all right, title and interest in and to the Work Product, including all proprietary rights therein. Supplier agrees to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and to do all such other acts and things, as may be requested by Purchaser from time to time to secure and preserve Purchaser’s rights hereunder, or to enforce, defend or confirm  Purchaser’s right to exploit those rights.  To the extent that ownership of Work Product cannot be transferred under applicable law, Supplier grants or undertakes to procure the grant to the Purchaser of a perpetual and irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide license to use any and all proprietary rights. Supplier will, at its own expense and as expeditiously as possible, perform all acts required to perfect any of the foregoing. </td> </tr>
